## Associated Documents

* [A Type System For OpenMath](ecc.pdf).  This document describes a formal type system
with dependent function types and products, based on the Extended Calculus of
Constructions, which can be used to augment the information in content dictionaries.
* [A Small OpenMath Type System](sts.pdf). As an alternative to the "ECC" type system we
also propose a "Small Type System" that is a more light weight system, specifically
designed to be used with OpenMath objects.
