title: OpenMath Content Dictionaries

## About

A content dictionary is the declaration of a collection of symbols, their names,
descriptions, and rules. A published CD allows multiple parties to "speak the same
OpenMath language".  An example of CD is [setname1](Official/setname1.html) which
indicates the semantics of such symbols such as the set of natural numbers.
  
CDs are grouped in CD-groups. For example, the [MathML CD group](../cdgroups/mathml.html)
collects the 'core CDs', all content-dictionaries described in the OpenMath standard
deemed compatible with the [MathML3 Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3)

## Curation

The [OpenMath Society](/society/) curates a set of [Content Dictionaries](/cd/) through
its [Editorial Board for Content Dictionaries](cdeb). For the CD submission and curation process see
[the CD FAQ](http://www.openmath.org/cd/faq/) and [the README on the CDs repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs/)

## CD indexes
  
* [CD Groups](../cdgroups/): A list of all {{ site.data.stats.cdgroups }} Content Dictionary Groups available on this server.
* [All CDs by Name](../cdnames/): A list of all {{ site.data.stats.cds }} Content Dictionaries (including contributed Dictionaries).
* [Index of all Symbols](../symbols/): A list of all {{ site.data.stats.cdsymbols }} symbols defined in any Content Dictionary (including contributed Dictionaries).
* [Git Repository](https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs): A github hosted repository, you can browse the files online,  download a zip file to your local machine, or clone the repository.

## Validation
Tools to validatate Cd and other OpenMath related files are described in the [validation](/validation) page, including an [online validation tool](/validation/omvalidate.html)

## FAQ

If you have trouble expressing yourself in terms of the existing CDs, maybe others had
too, and you can find the answer in the [OpenMath CDs FAQ](faq/)
