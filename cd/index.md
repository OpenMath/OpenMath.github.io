title: OpenMath Content Dictionaries

## About

A content dictionary is the declaration of a collection of symbols, their names,
descriptions, and rules. A published CD allows multiple parties to "speak the same
OpenMath language".  An example of CD is [setname1](setname1) which indicates the semantic
of such symbols such as the set of natural numbers.
  
CDs are grouped in CD-groups. For example, the [MathML CD group](../cdgroups/mathml.html)
collects the 'core CDs', all content-dictionaries described in the OpenMath standard
deemed compatible with the [MathML3 Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3)
