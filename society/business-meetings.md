title: The Business Meetings of the OpenMath Society
---

The annual buisiness meeting is the main decision-taking body of the of the
[OpenMath Society](.).

According to the statues the meeting has to take place in the first six months of the
year, which does not conform to the academic conference calenar. Therefore the president
organizes a pro-forma meeting, that does not make any decisions during that time frame and
we have a "working meeting" at the [OpenMath Workshop](../meetings). Find the minutes of
the recent meetings below.
