title: OpenMath Thematic Network
---

The OpenMath Thematic Network, which ran from July 2001 until June 2004, was a European
Union sponsored project (number IST-2000-29719) which was a follow on from the earlier
[ESPRIT Project](../esprit/index.html).

The project's main activities were:
1. to organise workshops bringing together people working on OpenMath from around the world;
2. to provide a continued focus-point for the development of the
   [OpenMath Standard](../../standard/index.html) and [Content Dictionaries](../../cd/index.html);
3. to facilitate European participation in the
[W3C Math Working group](http://www.w3c.org/math) by sponsoring the representatives from
[NAG](http://www.nag.co.uk), [Stilo Technology](http://www.stilo.com) and [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr). 
4. to coordinate the development of OpenMath and MathML tools, in particular stylesheets;
5.  to coordinate the development of OpenMath and MathML applications;
6.  to disseminate information about OpenMath and MathML.
