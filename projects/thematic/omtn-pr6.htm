<h2 align="center">Summary</h2>

During this last period of the project the Consortium completed the
OpenMath&nbsp;2 standard, and released a substantial collection of new
Content Dictionaries.  The W3C Math Working Group was reborn as a Math
Interest Group with a remit to support users and represent the interests
of mathematical markup to other W3C activities.
<p>
The Consortium's final workshop was held in <a
href="http://www.openmath.org/meetings/helsinki2004.html">Helsinki</a>
in May, and celebrated ten years of OpenMath.

<b>Notes:</b><br/>
As explained in the last management report, illness prevented the
production of deliverable D16, <em>New CD Release</em>.  Responsibility
for this release was assumed by NAG and Eindhoven, who produced a
combined deliverable covering both D16 and D20 (see task 1.1).
<br/>

<h3 align="center">Activity By Task</h3>

<h4>Task 1.1: Content Dictionaries</h4>

NAG and Eindhoven produced a new release, consisting of
58 brand new content dictionaries covering a range of topics in algebra,
plus
an update to all the existing content dictionaries to bring them into
line with the OpenMath&nbsp;2 standard.  The new  content dictionaries
have been designed to support the forthcoming edition of the interactive
textbook <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~ida/">Algebra Interactive</a>.
<p>
As requested by the reviewers, an overview document was also produced
describing the new content dictionaries and the changes to the existing
ones.

<h4>Task 1.2: The OpenMath Standard</h4>

Further drafts of the OpenMath 2 standard were released and discussed on
the <a href="mailto:om@openmath.org">public OpenMath mailing list</a>.
A final draft of the OpenMath 2 standard was discussed at the meeting in
Helsinki, and after some minor edits and corrections the finished
version was released via <a href="http://www.openmath.org">the OpenMath
Website</a> in June.  A list of the final changes made, along with
a version of the document highlighting all changes since
OpenMath&nbsp;1.1, was also prepared.
<p>
Work has begun on an accompanying primer document, giving a gentle
introduction to OpenMath for new users, but that will not be completed
in the lifetime of the project.

<h4>Task 1.3: MathML/W3C Coordination</h4>

A Math Interest Group was set up by W3C in April, to maintain the
existing documents, support users and liaise with other relevant groups
both inside and outside W3C.  One of the co-chairs is
David&nbsp;Carlisle from NAG Ltd.

<h4>Task 2.1: Tools &amp; Applications</h4>

An update to the <em>Recommendations for tool developers</em> document
was produced and put on the <a
href="http://www.openmath.org">website</a>.

<h4>Task 3.7: Seventh Workshop</h4>

This took place in Helsinki from May 21st-22nd 2004.  The slides are
available on the <a href="http://www.openmath.org">website</a>.

<h4>Task 3.8: Web Site</h4>

The content of the <a href="http://www.openmath.org">website</a> has
been updated regularly, and has been used to distribute draft versions
of the OpenMath 2 standard, and to distribute slides and papers from the
recent workshop.  Many links have also been updated.

<h3>Self-assessment</h3>

The Consortium believes that the OpenMath&nbsp;2 standard is a major
step forward and will help OpenMath's adoption as part of the wider
advance of XML and semantic web technologies.  The new Content
Dictionaries form a significant enlargement of the current collection
but still more work is needed in this area, and that is where we intent
to focus effort next, resources permitting. 

<h2 align="center"><a name="management">Project Management</a></h2>

For reasons explained in the last managemnt report, NAG and Eindhoven
took over responsibility for D16 and D20 from the University of Bath.
<p>
The Consortium continued to participate in the off-site review begun in
November 2003.  The final recommendations were received after the end of
the project and, while no firm commitment can be made to act on them, the
Consortium is grateful to the reviewers fro their constructive and
encouraging tone.
<p>
Responsibility for maintaining the website and the standards documents
has formally been handed over to the OpenMath Society.  Mike&nbsp;Dewar
of NAG Ltd.&nbsp;became Vice-President of the Society at its AGM in
Helsinki in May.

<h3 align="center">Effort in Person Months for Reporting Period January
1st - June 30th 2004</h3>

<br/>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ol type="i">
<li> Only NAG and The University of Bath have personnel budgets, and
only funded effort is reported here.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="page-break-before:always" align="center">Costs in KEuro for
Reporting Period January 1st - June 30th 2004</h3>



<br/>
<b>Notes:</b>
<ol type="i">
<li> These figures are based on claims submitted.</li>

<li> 
For the purpose of this report the previous expenditure by Explo-IT has
been subsumed into the Nibbles.it budget, i.e.&nbsp;they are being 
treated as one single entity.
</li>

<li>
Most partners have spent less than was originally forecast.  The reasons for
this are as follows:
<ul>

<li>The travel budgets were set on the basis that each partner would
send one representative to each workshop, at an average cost of 1250
Euros per trip.  In practice most partners have not been able to attend
every single workshop, and European air fares have dropped substantially
in the last two years, making each trip significantly less expensive
than expected.
</li>

<li>NAG, Stilo and INRIA had an additional travel budget to attend W3C
Math Working Group meetings.  We anticipated that there would be two
such meetings per year, normally in North America, and budgeted 2000
Euros per trip.  In fact the Math Working group has held only one
meeting per year, and the first of these was in Europe.
</li>

<li>NAG had an additional budget to fund new members, but few new
members have been recruited to the project.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Information Dissemination and Exploitation Of Results</h2>

The Consortium organised a workshop in Helsinki from May 21-22.  The
talks presented were:
