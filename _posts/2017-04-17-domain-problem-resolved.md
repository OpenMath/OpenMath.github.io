title: OpenMath Domain Problem resolved
---
With the passing of Mika Sepälä - founder and long-time president, the OpenMath Society
essentially lost control over the domain `openmath.org`, whiich Mika had registered in his
name via Florida State University at Talahassee. This is a non-trivial "legacy problem",
which could have cost OpenMath its established Web presence.

Working closely with FSU officials (thanks are due to Mikey Boyd for his help), James
Davenport has managed to resolve the problem and re-gain control over the domain, which
now has multiple contacts who can administer the registration.
