title: Alpha Version of the new OpenMath Web Site online
---
On the 206 OpenMath workshop we decided that we would relaunch the
OpenMath Web Site. Today we have released the alpha version to the OpenMath Community for inspection: http://openmath.github.io. It is
statically generated by jekyll based on the html and markdown sources in
the repository https://github.com/OpenMath/OpenMath.github.io and can be
edited/maintained by the usual git workflows.

We plan to go live with the page at the OpenMath workshop in Edinburgh
end of July.
