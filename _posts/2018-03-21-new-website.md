title: New OpenMath website
---
The new OpenMath website is online. It is
statically generated by Jekyll based on the HTML and Markdown sources in
the repository https://github.com/OpenMath/OpenMath.github.io and can be
edited and maintained by the usual Git workflows.

Thanks to this, an outside OpenMath enthusiast already submitted a couple of
[pull requests](https://github.com/OpenMath/OpenMath.github.io/pulls?q=is:pr)
fixing typos in the website. We hope such community involvement will continue.
