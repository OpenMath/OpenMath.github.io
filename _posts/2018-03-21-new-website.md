title: New OpenMath Web Site
---
The new OpenMath Web Site is online. It is
statically generated by jekyll based on the html and markdown sources in
the repository https://github.com/OpenMath/OpenMath.github.io and can be
edited/maintained by the usual git workflows.

This has already happened, an outside OpenMath enthusiast has submitted a couple of [pull requests](https://github.com/OpenMath/OpenMath.github.io/pulls) that fixed typos in the web site. We hope that such community involvement will continue.
