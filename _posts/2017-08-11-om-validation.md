title: New online validation tool for OpenMath files and CDs
---

An experimental online validator (using custom JavaScript, not the normative schema)
has been made available [on the OpenMath website](https://openmath.github.io/validation/).
Files can be uploaded by drag and drop  if that is supported by your browser, or the XML
text may may be entered into the text box supplied.

Note all validation is implemented in JavaScript and run in your local browser, no files
are uploaded to the OpenMath server by this tool.
