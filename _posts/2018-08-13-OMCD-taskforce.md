The [August 2018 Business meeting of the OpenMath Society](http://www.openmath.org/public/minutes/OM2016.pdf) in Hagenberg mandated a Task force for OpenMath CD changes. It initially econsists of James Davenport, Michael Kohlhase, Florian Rabe, Lars Hellstr√∂m, Moritz Schuboltz, Bruce Miller, and Jan Willem Knopper, further participants are welcome. The [current set of issues under consideration](https://github.com/openmath/OMSTD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AOMCD18) can be extended by [adding a new issue](https://github.com/openmath/OMSTD/issues) and labeling it "OMCD18".
