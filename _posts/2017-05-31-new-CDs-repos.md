title: New Repository and Submission Process for OpenMath CDs
---
In the ongoing renovation of the OpenMath web site and digital infrastructure, we have
created a new GitHub repository for OpenMath content dictionaries:
https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs

New CDs can be contributed simply by a merge request and the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs/issues) can be used for comments
and CD requests. See the [repository README](https://github.com/OpenMath/CDs) for
details.
