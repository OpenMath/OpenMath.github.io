title: 24th OpenMath Workshop

Bertinoro, Italy
July 20, 2011
co-located with [CICM 2011](http://cicm11.cs.unibo.it)
Continuous submission until July 10

##Objectives


With the release of [the MathML 3 W3C recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/), OpenMath enters a new phase of its development. Topics we expect to see at the workshop include


* Feature Requests (Standard Enhancement Proposals) and Discussions for OpenMath3

* Convergence of OpenMath and MathML 3

* Reasoning with OpenMath

* Software using or processing OpenMath

* New OpenMath Content Dictionaries



though others related to OpenMath are certainly welcomed. For examples of contributions see [the 22nd OpenMath Workshop of 2009](http://staff.bath.ac.uk/masjhd/OM2009.html#contributions).


Contributions can be either full research papers, Standard Enhancement Proposals, or a description of new Content Dictionaries, particularly ones that are suggested for formal adoption by the OpenMath Society.


##Important Dates (all times are GMT)


OpenMath 2011 does not have a submission deadline. Submissions will be accepted until July 10 and reviewed and notified continuously.


##Submissions


Submission is by e-mail to [omws2011@googlegroups.com](mailto:omws2011@googlegroups.com). Papers must conform to the [Springer LNCS style](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0), preferably using LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class files.
