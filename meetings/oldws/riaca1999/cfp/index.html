The 12th OpenMath Workshop is a meeting place for developers and users
of the OpenMath standard. It is an occasion for presenting the recent
developments and applications of OpenMath and for suggesting new
directions.

<P>

OpenMath is an emerging standard for communicating semantically-rich
representations of mathematical objects between all kinds of computer
programs. The communication can take place between software packages
and on the World Wide Web. The associated tools will permit the
display, manipulation and access of mathematical information stored
electronically.  OpenMath is highly relevant for working with large
engineering type databases (in heavy industry like aerospace, car
manufacturing, e.g.) as well as for technical and mathematical
publishing.
<P>
OpenMath intends to provide standards for mechanisms which permit the
interactive manipulation of mathematical objects inside a web browser.
So far they were not available, despite the overwhelming prevalence of
web-based technology.

	<TR><TH colspan="2">Submissions</TH></TR>
	<TR><TD colspan="2">

Papers may be up to 10 pages in length and extended abstract up to 5
pages. A cover sheet must display the author's name, institution,
email and postal addresses, and an abstract. Systems demonstrations
are also invited. Authors must state in the cover sheet whether they
intend to offer a demonstration of a running system.  Submissions
should be sent electronically, in (La)TeX source, or as an HTML
document to the Program Chair: <tt>wsom99@win.tue.nl</tt> before May 1.
The submissions will either be accepted or rejected for presentation
by the program committee before May 15. Final versions of accepted
papers will be due by May 30. Accepted papers will appear in the
informal proceedings of the workshop and will be made available via
the <A HREF="http://www.openmath.org" target=_new>OpenMath Society web
site</a>, provided the authors agree.  This enables authors to submit
their work also to journals or conferences with a proper refereeing
procedure. The main role of the program committee will be to filter
the submissions so as to ensure a balanced workshop and good quality
contributions.
