<TH>How to get to Eindhoven</TH>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<STRONG> By plane </STRONG> Eindhoven has a small airport, with regular
flights to Amsterdam (Schiphol) and some foreign cities. Look <A
HREF="http://wtravelweb.itn.net/cgi/get?itn/pl/travelweb/index"
target=_new> here </A> for the availability of flights, or consult
your local agency.  From the airport you can take a taxi to the city
centre (approx. Dfl 40,-).
<br>
In case you fly to Amsterdam, you have the option of taking the train
(cheaper) or a connecting flight (usually faster, but often not that
much) to Eindhoven.
