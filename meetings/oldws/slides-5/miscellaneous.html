<H2>Notes from Workshop 5: 12 January 1996</H2>

Shawn Sheridan participated by telephone.

<H3>The MathLink Proposal</H3>

Mike Seppala requested clarification of the MathLink proposal.  Shawn
Sheridan recalled that MathLink will be made public domain if OpenMath uses
it, and OpenMath becomes accepted as an international standard.  It was
concluded that official confirmation from WRI of this situation must be
obtained.  Shawn reiterated that free copies of Mathematica would be made
available for prototyping purposes inside OpenMath.

<H3>Availability of ASAP</H3>

Stephen Watt summaried the Communications Committee report for those
unfamiliar with it.  He pointed out that ASAP is available for public ftp.
Previously ASAP had been available only for Unix platforms but a version
for PC-windows now exists.  INRIA is willing to place ASAP in the public
domain, and both source code (in C) and documentation are available via
anonymous ftp.  Some technical support for ASAP may be obtained from INRIA,
but the documentation is not complete enough to allow reimplementation in
LISP, say.  The PhD thesis of Alain Sausse (in French) contains more
details.  The main advantage of ASAP over MathLink is that ASAP is "free";
the main disadvantage is that ASAP is not as slick as commercial software.

<P>
MP is also public domain, with source in C available via anonymous ftp.  MP
does not offer an "urgent channel".
