<H2>Notes from Workshop 5: afternoon session, 11 January 1996</H2>

Shawn Sheridan participated by telephone.

<P>
There was a discussion on the transport layer; in particular, it was noted
that the communications report did not resolve the issue of ASAP-style
urgent messages versus MathLink-style ones.  Everyone approved the idea
that the two alternatives should be compared in prototypes, and then the
decision should be taken.

<P>
A new potential problem was raised: how can a client interrupt the server
in the middle of sending a long message.  The main difficulty here is that
if the message being transmitted is abruptly truncated then it may not be
well-formed; this may cause difficulties for the client receiving the message.
Since a byte-stream transport layer has been assumed, the end of a truncated
message must be marked explicitly -- this could be tricky if opaque binary
data can be sent.  MathLink does allow premature termination of messages
because MLEndPacket() can be called at any atom boundary.

<P>
Another potential problem is that urgent messages may be delayed (e.g. by
network troubles), and could arrive at the server after it has begun
handling the next normal request.  It was proposed that urgent messages
should thus carry the identity of the request which they are supposed to
interrupt, and if that request has already been completed then the urgent
message is discarded.  It was not decided what should happen if the
indicated request is still queued for handling.  Shawn noted that
MathLink urgent messages do not (at this stage) carry such request-ID
information because it is expected to be used in a "transaction scheme"
(i.e. where requests are not queued up at the server).  It was pointed out
that we ought to consider the needs of parallel process management, which
seem to resemble the scenarios given in the discussion.

<P>
The question of whether interrupts should be forwarded by intermediate
processes in a chain of processes was raised.  The general feeling was
that each process in the chain should decide how to handle the interrupt
(the behaviour of each process should be given in its documentation).
