Workshop 5 took place at the University of Bath.  At this workshop there
were relatively few presentations; most of the time was spent in
discussions or in small working groups.  There was also a "private"
OpenMath meeting during the two days prior to the workshop.  A handful of
notes and slides from this workshop are available, and mini-reports from
the working groups should appear soon.
