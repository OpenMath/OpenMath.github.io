<H2>Future directions</H2>

After the talks and discussions, a general discussion was held to determine
what to do next.  There was a common feeling, also expressed in various
presentations, that a precise definition of what OpenMath is and what
problems it is intending to solve are, is required.  The results of this
discussion were the formation of two committees to oversee the continued
development of the OpenMath standard.

<P>
The first of these committees is charged with the development of a position
paper which is to state precisely what the goals and purposes of OpenMath
are, and what aspects should be kept in mind when designing the actual
protocol.  This committee is to produce its paper and circulate it by e-mail
by 30 September 1994.  The members of the committee are:<BR>
<B>Michael Richardson, Marcel Roelofs, Andreas Strotmann, Stefan Vorkoetter.</B>

<P>
The second committee is then to (re)write the OpenMath specification based
on the paper produced by the first committee.  The revised specification is
to be completed by 31 December 1994.  The members of the second committee
are:<BR>
<B>John Abbott, Marc Gaetano, Ruediger Loos, Robert Sutor, Stefan Vorkoetter.</B>

<P>
Both committees will confer by electronic mail.

<P>
James Davenport was asked to contact the SGML standards group to inform
them of OpenMath and to see if we can work with them in any way.

<P>
Chris Howlett and Stefan Vorkoetter will continue communications and
contacts with the standardization bodies to find possible overlaps and to
identify a group where it could be suitable to present OpenMath for
standardization.  Prof R. Loos will contact DIN to explore the contacts with
the Application Layer Definition group.

<P>
E-mail will continue to be our main communication means.  RIACA will
organize a centralized mailing list in cooperation with the existing ones
at Waterloo Maple Software and the POSSO group.  It is expected that either
WMS or RIACA with set up a WWW server with all the information (proposals,
previous e-mail, papers, etc) available.

<P>
A tentative schedule of future meetings was proposed by Dr M. Seppala:
<UL>
<LI> February 1995, at Amsterdam
<LI> September 1995, at Canterbury (or Copenhagen)
<LI> February 1996, at Bath
<LI> September 1996, at Zurich
</UL>
These meetings will receive partial funding from the HCM proposal recently
granted by the EU.
