<B>Friday, 26th July 1996</B>

<PRE>
Private session in late afternoon/evening.
 * Discussion on applying for further funding for OpenMath.
 * Discussion about contexts.
     Topics should include the internal structure of contexts,
     the delineation of a context (i.e. guidelines on how large an
     area should it cover), and the establishment of a context
     registration committee.

09:00   G Gonnet  "Welcome to Zurich"

09:05   <A HREF="mailto:gonnet@inf.ethz.ch">G Gonnet</A>  <A HREF="slides-6/SemanticDictionaries.html"><B>"Semantic Dictionaries in OpenMath"</B></A>

09:30   <A HREF="mailto:Stephen.Watt@sophia.inria.fr">S Watt</A>    <A HREF="slides-6/INRIAPrototype.html"><B>"The INRIA OpenMath Prototype"</B></A>
        Based largely on the published specification for OpenMath prototype2.1
        the group at INRIA have built some implementations.  This talk
        describes alterations made to the specification, and covers the
        work invested in creating a collection of OpenMath contexts intended
        to offer a solid foundation on which to build further contexts.

10:10   <A HREF="mailto:diaza@cs.rpi.edu">A Diaz</A>    <A HREF="slides-6/ContextRegistry.html"><B>"The OpenMath Context Server and Registry"</B></A>
        A vital part of making new contexts available is a "publishing"
        mechanism.  I describe the first prototype OpenMath context server,
        and discuss various improvements which are planned.  Ideas on how
        to extend this to multiple sites will also be put forward.

10:30   Coffee break

11:00   <A HREF="mailto:sb@stilo.demon.co.uk">S Buswell</A> <A HREF="slides-6/SemanticDTD.html"><B>"A Proposed Semantic Mathematical SGML DTD"</B></A>
        The work on HTML-Math is presentation based.  In this talk I describe
        an SGML DTD which is based on semantics; this semantic information
        is important if the formula is to be extracted from the SGML document
        and processed by mathematically sophisticated software.

11:20   <A HREF="mailto:sutor@watson.ibm.com">R Sutor</A>   <A HREF="slides-6/techexplorer.html"><B>"techexplorer and OpenMath: WWW Scientific Publishing"</B></A>
        In this talk I'll discuss how we would like to use OpenMath to enable
        techexplorer documents to contain mathematical content that could
        be visually transferred to other applications.

11:40   <A HREF="mailto:sutor@watson.ibm.com">R Sutor</A>   <A HREF="slides-6/ObjectCompatibility.html"><B>"A Proposed OpenMath Object Compatibility Standard"</B></A>
        On a given platform, e.g., Windows 95 or the Macintosh, the full
        OpenMath standard with encoding and communications protocols
        is overkill. In this talk I'll discuss why I think we need an "Object 
        Standard" and how OpenMath could work with Windows OLE/ActiveX
        technology.

12:00   <A HREF="mailto:sutor@watson.ibm.com">R Sutor</A>   <A HREF="slides-6/HTML-Math.html"><B>"Update on the HTML Math standards effort"</B></A>
        I have recently joined the W3C HTML Math Editorial Review Board who
        are working on an HTML representation for maths.  I shall present
        an overview of the current state of HTML-Math.

12:25   Lunch

14:30   <A HREF="mailto:abbott@can.nl">J Abbott</A>  <A HREF="slides-6/NetworkCompatibility.html"><B>"OpenMath Network Compatibility"</B></A>
        On platforms which do not have a native object transfer protocol
        it is necessary for OpenMath to define its own "encoding".  In this
        talk I shall discuss the latest developments in OpenMath encodings.

14:50   <A HREF="mailto:abbott@can.nl">J Abbott</A>  <A HREF="slides-6/PrototypeNews.html"><B>"OpenMath Prototypes"</B></A>
        I shall describe the design (and justification) of the latest OpenMath
        prototype, and also highlight some shortcomings with ideas on how
        to avoid these in the next prototype.

15:20   <A HREF="mailto:simon@orgel.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de">G Simon</A>   <A HREF="slides-6/SAC2-LiDIA.html"><B>"Communication Interface between SAC--2 and LiDIA"</B></A>
        In this talk I will summarize some experiences on the basis of a
        sample application implemented using a CORBA like system (ILU).
        I think, in some cases, it would be possible to combine this approach 
        with OpenMath (or a subset of them).

16:00   Coffee break

16:30   <B>Discussion about prototyping.</B>
        Topics should include: general future strategy, development of more
        contexts (and their interim management), which languages/systems
        should OpenMath supply implementations for, relative importance for
        the inclusion of currently absent features,...

17:30   Close

09:00   <A HREF="mailto:jhd@maths.bath.ac.uk">J Davenport</A>    <A HREF="slides-6/types.html"><B>"Some Ideas for Types in OpenMath"</B></A>
        The design of the AXIOM system highlights the benefits of keeping
        detailed type information.  I wish to present some arguments about
        the type information which OpenMath should include.

09:30   <B>Discussion on types and OpenMath.</B>
        Topics may also include discussion about the internal structure of a
        context, and how contexts may be parametrized.

10:00   <A HREF="mailto:hannes@mathematik.uni-kl.de">H Schoenemann</A>  <A HREF="slides-6/DistPoly.ps.gz"><B>"Experiences with Distributed Polynomial Computations"</B></A>
        I want to contribute some conclusions/suggestions arising
        from our experiences with MP/MPP (and other "communication protocols")
        to the "OM prototype 2.1".

10:30   Coffee break

11:00   <B>Discussion on the next stage for OpenMath.</B>
        Topics should include: general future strategy, establishing
        productive links with the developers of various systems, establishing
        good contacts with the "electronic publishing" world, creating a
        more formal "project".

12:30   End of workshop.
