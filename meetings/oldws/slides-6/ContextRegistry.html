One result of the <A HREF="http://www.can.nl/~abbott/OpenMath/">OpenMath</A> 
design committee's mini-meeting at RIACA (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was a 
<A HREF="http://www.can.nl/~abbott/OpenMath/prototypes/Meeting-Eindhoven.html">
proposed syntax definition for OpenMath contexts.</A> In response to
the aforementioned specification, several <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/">
Java</A> applications are currently being developed to facilitate the creation, 
maintenance and archival of such contexts. This talk will detail a
prototypical arena for the maintenance and registry of OpenMath contexts
with the intent of stimulating discussion relevant to both OpenMath 
context syntax and the context registry mechanism. In the interim, such an 
arena aims to encourage the rapid creation of OpenMath contexts and 
ultimately to provide a procedure for context maintenance and archival. 
Finally, our plans for further refinement and development of the OpenMath 
registry are presented.

<A NAME="OMCR"></A><H1>1. The OpenMath Context Registry</H1>
<P>The OpenMath context registry aims to serve as a focal point for the 
collaborative creation, maintenance and archival of OpenMath contexts.
In our view, this early prototype of an OpenMath context registry is
intended to stimulate the rapid creation of OpenMath contexts while providing 
an arena for discussion relevant to the OpenMath context syntax and the 
context registry mechanism. In the interim, the audience for this prototypical 
implementation are parties interested in this endeavor. The
following text details several items that may serve as the 
impetus for the ultimate incarnation of the OpenMath context registry.
</P>
<A NAME="GOALS"></A><H2>1.1 Goals</H2>
<UL>
   <LI> Allow for the collaborative creation and maintenance of OpenMath
        contexts in a secure fashion</LI>
   <LI> Serve as a public archive of OpenMath contexts</LI>
   <LI> Supply up to date context information</LI>
   <LI> Provide a cross-platform implementation so as to reach the largest
        possible audience</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="AUDIENCE"></A><H2>1.2 Target Audience</H2>
<UL>
   <LI> Researchers interested in forming or joining a group to 
        develop/modify OpenMath contexts
   <LI> Developers of OpenMath compliant applications</LI>
</UL>

<CENTER><P><HR WIDTH="100%" ></P></CENTER>

<A NAME="ARENA"></A><H1>2. An Arena for Context Registry</H1>

<P>Our proposed arena for realizing the OpenMath context registry is a 
World Wide Web based client/server application. By taking advantage of
several Internet protocols, standards, and Java, a freely available 
cross-platform language, the aforementioned goals may be achieved.</P>

<P>In this scenario, OpenMath contexts are accessed and maintained through
a Java coded OpenMath context registry server. Access to the server is
accomplished via either a Java registry client applet or a stand-alone 
Java registry client.  While the registry client applet only requires a 
Java enabled Web browser or applet viewer for the purpose of execution, 
both the registry server and stand-alone registry client require the 
utilization of a Java interpreter (see section 3.3).</P>

<P> The reason we provide two Java registry clients is that in Netscape 
Navigator 2.0 or higher, <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/sfaq/index.html#read">
applets cannot read or write files</A>. The stand-alone registry client
adds the functionality of context file up-load and down-load.</P>

 In what follows is an initial specification for the organization of contexts,
the OpenMath context registry server and the OpenMath context registry client.
We will also comment on several thoughts currently under consideration which
relate to the additional functionality that the context registry should
exhibit.

<A NAME="CONTEXT"></A><H2>2.1 Context Organization</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Official - stable; entries will never be deleted, but new entries may
    appear occasionally</LI>
<LI>On-Track - due soon to be converted to "official" status, should be fairly
    stable; entries may be deleted, new entries may be added</LI>
<LI>Unofficial - no guarantees about stability, there may be two or more
    unofficial contexts covering essentially the same area; these are 
    primarily for people working at extending OpenMath</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="SERVER"></A><H2>2.2 The OpenMath Context Registry Server</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Listen for requests on a dedicated port</LI>
<LI>Fetch OpenMath contexts</LI>
<LI>Provide a user and group level "accounting" system for sensitive 
    transactions</LI>
<LI>Implement secure context removal and archival</LI>
<LI>Oversee collaborative context creation and maintenance (group level)</LI>
<LI>Implement a context locking mechanism</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="CLIENT"></A><H2>2.3 The OpenMath Context Registry Client</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Allow for automatic and manual registry connection</LI>
<LI>Provide a mechanism for OpenMath context browsing</LI>
    <UL>
    <LI>Retrieve a list of available contexts</LI>
    <LI>Context fetch and display</LI>
    <LI>Follow "hyper-links" referring to other contexts</LI>
    </UL>
<LI>Allow for user/group authentication</LI> 
<LI>Enact a context authoring environment</LI>
    <UL>
    <LI>Allow for single user context creation/maintenance</LI>
        <UL>
        <LI>Provide a mechanism for syntactically correct insertion/deletion 
            of context entries</LI>
        </UL>
    <LI>Facilitate collaborative context creation/maintenance</LI>
        <UL>
        <LI>Provide a mechanism for syntactically correct insertion/deletion
            of context entries</LI>
        <LI>Display participants, as well as, their respective context control 
            properties</LI>
        <LI>Provide a "chat pad" for collaborative context development</LI> 
        </UL>
    </UL>
<LI>Implement a secure method of context removal and archival</LI>
<LI>Allow for context file up-load and down-load (stand-alone version)</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="ADDFUNC"></A><H2>2.4 Additional Functionality</H2>

<P>In order to alleviate potential network congestion, the OpenMath consortium
could maintain several registries residing in different geographical locations.
Initially, a mirror site would be a copy of the registry which does not 
support any updating operations. If necessary, we could extend the
registry functionality to include several "principal" sites. Each principal
site would allow both context retrieval and updating. This, however, would
involve a more intimate coupling between each principal registry server.</P>

<P>In light of the potential danger of stale context versions, a user
could utilize the registry home page to declare his/her "interest" 
in a particular list of contexts. The registry would keep track of updates and 
inform the interested parties via email.</P>

<CENTER><P><HR WIDTH="100%" ></P></CENTER>

<A NAME="PROTO"></A><H1>3. Our Current Prototype</H1>

<P>Our prototypical "OpenMath Context Registry" home page can be reached by 
following:</P> 

<P><A HREF="http://www2.cs.rpi.edu/projects/OpenMath"><TT>
http://www2.cs.rpi.edu/projects/OpenMath</TT>
</A>(OpenMath Registry Home Page)</P>

<P>This page provides additional information regarding our current 
implementation and enables access to our context registry via a context 
registry client applet. Furthermore, the context registry home page publishes 
an online user's guide detailing the utilization of the context registry 
client.

<P>The contexts currently archived are intended to demonstrate our prototype`s
functionality and context syntax. It is our hope that recent discussions with
St&#233phane Dalmas and Marc Gaetano, members of the 
<A HREF="http://www.inria.fr/safir/index-eng.html">SAFIR</A> (Formal Algebraic 
Systems for Industry and Research) group in France, will produce a unified 
context design, as well as some initial OpenMath contexts.</P>

<P>This prototype implements a subset of the initial registry specifications
detailed in section 2. At this point, the functionality offered by our
prototype server and clients are summarized. By utilizing "screen shots", we 
provide an overview of the steps involved in context creation and registry.
</P>

<A NAME="PSERVER"></A><H2>3.1 The Prototype Registry Server</H2>

 The OpenMath Registry Server maintains and protects the OpenMath context
archive. The server's current functionality includes:

<UL>
<LI>Listens for requests on a dedicated port</LI> 
<LI>Handles each request as a separate thread - each thread consequently 
    communicates via a newly allocated socket</LI>
<LI>Requires session authentication for sensitive transactions
    (store and delete context)</LI>
<LI>Enacts context fetch, store and delete operations, as well as, 
    the registry directory operation</LI> 
</UL> 

<A NAME="PCLIENT"></A><H2>3.2 The Prototype Registry Client</H2>

 The OpenMath registry client is intended to provide a graphical front
end to the OpenMath registry server. This prototype includes the
following functionality:
<UL>
<LI> Provides a restricted context authoring mechanism - one can
     sequentially add "syntactically correct" context entries</LI>
<LI> Allows for both non-authenticated transactions (context fetch,
     registry directory listing) and authenticated interchange 
     (context save, delete)</LI>
<LI> Automatically establishes an OpenMath registry session</LI>
<LI> Permits manual OpenMath registry session initialization - one can
     reconnect in the case of unforeseen network situations</LI>
</UL> 

<A NAME="PAPPLET"></A><H3>3.2.1 The Client Applet</H3>
<P>The registry client consists of three areas :
a control panel, an editing pad and a status window. <A HREF="ContextRegistry-images/ce2.gif">
Click here for a full screen shot of the context registry client.</A></P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/control.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 1</B> : Control Panel</H3></CENTER>

<P>Upon initialization the registry client reads several "parameters" specified 
within the HTML file and attempts to connect to an OpenMath registry server. 
In the case of unforeseen network situations, the registry server may not be 
available. In this scenario, a user can utilize the editing facility and 
attempt to connect to the registry at a later time. Figure 1 displays
the client control panel. In this example, a connection to the registry
has been established and the LinearAlgebra context has been selected from 
the list of available contexts.</P>

<P>Buttons located at the bottom of the control panel area refer to
actions related to the context pad, while buttons that are left aligned 
perform context registry related operations.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/ccp.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 2</B> : Status Window</H3></CENTER>

<P>Also, an external status window is spawned on applet initialization. The
intent is to provide detailed information regarding the results and status of
all registry client operations.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/auth.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 3</B> : User Authentication</H3></CENTER>

<P>This prototype supports user level authentication. The "Authenticate" action
button produces a pop-up user authentication dialog window. Internally, on
authentication success, the registry client is given a unique randomly
selected session identification by the registry server. Sensitive transactions 
are accomplished by the utilization of this id. Please note that in this
prototype, authentication is not required for the context fetch and registry 
directory listing operations.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/pad.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 4</B> : Context Editing Pad</H3></CENTER>

<P>Figure 4 exhibits the context pad area. In this example, user "diaz" has
down loaded the LinearAlgebra context from the registry. This context was 
retrieved by selecting the LinearAlgebra entry from the registry directory 
listing and clicking on the "Get Context" action button.  Context key
words are displayed in red while context hyper-links are displayed in blue.
This prototype does not fully support the context hyper-link mechanism.
In this implementation, context scrolling is achieved by taking advantage 
of several pre-defined hot keys. It is expected that our next prototype
will provide scroll bars for this functionality</P> 

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/insert.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 5</B> : Insert a Context Entry</H3></CENTER>

<P>One would ultimately be able to click on the context pad to initiate a 
"Context Wizard" (see figure 5). The wizard provides the user with all of the
possible syntactically correct context entry types at any given point. 
This prototype only allows the insertion and deletion of context entries and 
the end of a context document.</P>

<P>Once a context is ready for archival, a user can update the registry
to reflect the local changes. This is accomplished by utilizing the "Send
Context Pad" action button. This action will update the current directory 
of contexts automatically. If desired a manual update can be achieved
at any instance via the "Refresh Context List" action button. Also, contexts 
may be removed from the archive by utilizing the "Delete Context" action 
button.</P>

<A NAME="PALONE"></A><H3>3.2.2 The Client Stand-Alone Application</H3>

 The stand-alone Java registry client enhances the functionality and
interface of the Java registry client applet by allowing context file 
up-load and down-load. Context down-load facilitates local context archival,
while context up-load permits a user to create/maintain a context employing 
another editing mechanism.

<A NAME="IPC"></A><H2>3.3 Implementation and Platform Considerations</H2>

<P>Applets loaded over the Internet can only establish
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/sfaq/index.html#prevent">
network connections to the originating host.</A> For this reason, it is
required that the OpenMath registry server execute on the same compute node
as the Web server.</P>

<P>Both the OpenMath registry server and stand-alone context registry
client require the utilization of a Java interpreter for the purpose of 
execution. Each of the aforementioned applications have been tested using the 
Java interpreter provided in the 
<A HREF= "http://www.javasoft.com/java.sun.com/products/JDK/index.html">
JDK 1.0.2</A> on the following platforms: Microsoft Windows NT/95, Linux 2.0,
SPARC/Solaris, x86/Solaris.</P>

<P>The applet form of the registry client requires a Java applet viewer. The
JDK provides an applet viewer, as well as, 
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape 2.0</A>  or higher, on most 
platforms. Due to several problems with the Microsoft Windows NT/95 
Netscape implementation, the context registry client Java applet causes
Netscape to perform an "illegal" operation. Microsoft Windows NT/95 users can 
take advantage of the functionality offered by the context registry client
applet by utilizing either the JDK applet viewer or the 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie"> Microsoft Internet explorer 3.0 
Beta 1</A> or higher.</P>

<CENTER><P><HR WIDTH="100%" ></P></CENTER>

<A NAME="PLANS"></A><H1>4. Plans for the future</H1>

<P>Our current focus revolves around obtaining a stable definition for
the syntax and file format of OpenMath contexts and a concrete specification 
for the functionality of the OpenMath context registry. It is our hope that 
this prototype encourages steps in the aforementioned directions.</P> 

<CENTER><IMG SRC="ContextRegistry-images/control2.gif"></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3><B>Figure 6</B> : The Next Iteration Control Panel</H3></CENTER>

<P>Plans for the next iteration of our prototype include the full 
implementation of the specifications detailed in section 2.
Figure 6 displays a proposed interface for achieving the set forth
specifications.<A HREF="ContextRegistry-images/alpha2.0.gif">Click here for a full screen 
shot of a candidate interface for the next iteration of the context 
registry.</A></P>
