<H2>Current State</H2>

Recently two prototypes have been developed at RIACA, called 2.0R and 2.1R.
The first was for a demonstration at an OpenMath mini-meeting in May, the
second was for a demonstration at MEGA'96.  The main differences between
the two prototypes came from discussions at that mini-meeting.  So far 2.1R
has been implemented in REDUCE and Maple, with an almost complete
implementation in CoCoA.  An important aspect of the public release of 2.1R
is that detailed specifications were included in the release thus allowing
users of other systems and languages to build their own implementations:
in particular, the group at INRIA(Nice) has taken the challenge to build a
prototype "independently" to test the accuracy and completeness of the
specifications -- this prototype is called 2.1I (I is for INRIA).

<P>
Current designs have assumed point-to-point use of OpenMath, partly because
this seems to allow easier designs, and partly because the designers have
only limited experience of parallel computation.  The restriction to
point-to-point will eventually be lifted.


<H3>The Truth</H3>

The implementations of 2.1R in REDUCE and Maple used file copying (and
system calls) as the data transport mechanism, and were thus unacceptably
slow for many uses.  We recall that the <A
HREF="../../reports/comms.ps.gz">communications committee report</A>
specified the interface which the transport layer must offer, but did not
require a particular transport mechanism to be used.  This file copying
mechanism is indeed a compliant OpenMath transport layer, but is
practicable only for coarse grained distributed computing.

<P>
On a Unix platform the preferred transport medium for interprocess
communication would normally be a socket, but currently neither Maple nor
REDUCE supports socket operations.  The CoCoA implementation is hampered by
even more restricted I/O capability, though this should soon be rectified.
Direct socket-based intercommunication would make relatively fine grained
distributed computing feasible, but before OpenMath (or any similar
communications scheme) can be implemented to use sockets directly, the
developers of the various systems must make available the necessary socket
operations.  Similar comments apply to other transport media, other
platforms, and other mathematical software packages.

<P>
A normal implementation of an OpenMath sender/receiver will comprise an
essentially static section of code (corresponding to the conversions
between the levels OpenMath object and OpenMath encoding), together with
the code forming the phrase book.  Normally the phrase book for a given
system will have to be updated whenever there is a change in the contexts
covering the domain of computation of that system.  Thus during the initial
stages of OpenMath, many phrase books will change relatively often, more or
less hand in hand with the introduction of new contexts or the extension of
existing contexts.  As OpenMath matures, phrase books will become more
static; indeed, for the more specialized systems it is even possible that
the phrase book may never need to change.  On the other hand, the phrase
books for more general mathematical systems may never become completely
static -- this should be borne in mind when designing the implementation of
the phrase book.


<HR>
<H2>Critical Appraisal</H2>

Here we describe some of the main points of the most recent prototype
(2.1), and comment on how well the design has worked, and when appropriate
suggest ways to improve the design for the next prototype.  The order of
the points is not special.


<A NAME="conversations"><H3>Conversations</H3></A>

One idea common to the last two prototypes is that of the
<b>conversation</b>.  Conversations were invented to supersede the unpopular
idea of "variable anonymization" presented at Bath.  The main purpose of a
conversation is to maintain a certain amount of global state in which
messages are exchanged.  The participants in a conversation may refer to
and alter the global state during the course of the conversation.

<P>
There are three separate parts to this global state: a context of user
parameters, a list of OpenMath symbols, and a list of stored values.  The
first part achieves more or less what "variable anonymization" aimed to
accomplish, and extends the idea.  The second part permits a compact
encoding, and the third allows shared substructure to be retained during
transmission.  This scheme worked well for the (small) examples used during
the demonstrations, and allowed a fairly simple implementation.

<P>
The purpose of the list of OpenMath symbols could, in fact, be served by
the list of stored values, thereby simplifying the design.  This potential
simplification to the design should be investigated in a future prototype.

<P>
There is currently no way to clear out old stored values which we know will
never be used again in the future.  The removal of stored values was
forbidden so that there was no possible risk of creating a "dangling
pointer"; instead there is the risk that a conversation might "fill up"
with large amounts of useless stored values.  A solution to this problem is
not evident; we suspect that in most practical situations excessive
"filling up" will not occur, and propose that the problem be ignored for
the time being.


<H3>Asynchronicity</H3>

Having permitted the existence of global state which can be updated by any
member of the conversation at any time, the possibility of race conditions
had to be eliminated (because OpenMath does not impose any synchronicity
conditions on the participants in a conversation).  This difficulty can
even arise in point-to-point usage.

<P>
A satisfactory solution seems to have been found: the global state is
partitioned into pieces each one being "owned" by a single member of the
conversation.  Each piece is a triple: parameter context, list of OpenMath
symbols, and list of stored values.  Each member may modify only the piece
belonging to itself, but may refer to symbols and values in any piece.
Naturally, a reference has to record whose piece the value referred to comes
from.  This idea is more complicated to describe in words than it is to
visualize or to implement.


<H3>User Parameters and Phrase Books</H3>

We recall that the purpose of the phrase book is to effect the
translation between an application specific representation of some
mathematical object, and a semantically identical OpenMath object.
Additionally, for prototype2.1 we assumed that all symbols appearing in
an OpenMath object must come from a context.  Consequently, symbols
appearing as (user) parameters in a formula must correspond to entries in
some context.

<P>
To support this, a phrase book is allowed to add new entries to a special
run-time context which contains only entries for (user) parameters.  The
phrase book must also handle the reverse situation: a newly introduced
parameter in an OpenMath object must be translated to a symbol different
from all other symbols appearing in the application specific representation
of that object.  This facility was needed for the polynomial decomposition
demonstration.

<P>
In prototype2.1 only a minimal amount of information about a parameter was
included in the context entry: a string being the original "print name" of
the parameter.  This was a stopgap solution in case the parameter needed to
be displayed to the user (e.g. during debugging).  A future prototype will
surely use a more sophisticated way of indicating how to typeset/print the
user symbol; this would include information about whether it is printed as
a prefix, infix or postfix operator (or even as a superscript), whether
arguments are printed in the usual way or as subscripts/superscripts/etc or
perhaps not even printed at all.  Assuming OpenMath endorses type
information, each parameter would also have some type information, possibly
only a partially specified type (e.g. a matrix with unknown dimensions and
unknown ring of entries).


<H3>Phrase Books and Exported Commands</H3>

For these prototypes it was decided that each command exported via an
OpenMath interface should be associated with a particular OpenMath symbol;
thus remote execution of a command could be effected by issuing the
corresponding symbol and the data upon which the command is to act.  The
human-readable part of the context would explain what precisely the command
does, and the types and order of the arguments.  In the future we expect
that the "signature" of the command may be held in a machine comprehensible
form.

<P>
In the prototype implementations we found that the phrase books consisted
of four distinct types of code: stub routines for making remote procedure
calls, (small) interface procedures one for each exported command, data I/O
routines (converting between the OpenMath representation and the
application's internal representation), and some server routines for
receiving and processing remote procedure calls.

<P>
To increase the range of commands which the system can call via the
OpenMath interface it is necessary only to add one or more new stub
routines.  To increase the range of commands which the system exports via
its OpenMath interface it is necessary only to write the (usually small)
interface procedure; possibly a small addition to one of the server
routines would be needed to (depending on the host language/system).  If a
new type of data is to be handled then the relevant I/O routines must be
added.  We can see from this that the various parts of the phrase are
fairly well decoupled from each other, thus making it quite easy to extend
the system's OpenMath interface.  It is not necessary that the phrase book
be implemented in this way, but our experience shows that this design has
many advantages.


<H3>Node Types in OpenMath Trees</H3>

In prototype2.1, there were really too many different types of nodes in
OpenMath trees: 15 altogether.  The main objections to having many
different types of node are the high conceptual complexity, and the
corresponding bulk of the code for sending and receiving OpenMath trees.
Probably the correct action is to choose an adequate specification for the
moment, and review it after some practical experience has been gained.

<P>
Changing the definition of the OpenMath data-structure (currently the
OpenMath tree) would be a fundamental change, which should be reflected in
a new top-level version number.  All the existing implementations would
have to be changed accordingly, including phrase books.  Consequently,
there is a strong incentive to minimize the number of such changes; or,
equivalently, after OpenMath has become sufficiently widespread it would be
impractical to attempt such a fundamental change.


<H3>Lack of Error Handling</H3>

Although present in the specification of prototype2.1, error handling was
not implemented in any of REDUCE, Maple or CoCoA largely due to lack of
time (and it was hoped that it wouldn't be needed during the
demonstrations).  We note that some systems and languages support exception
handling directly, while others do not: this greatly affects the ease of
implementing proper error handling.  There will always be some error
conditions which cannot be handled (e.g. power failure).

<P>
The design of error handling in OpenMath prototype2.1 is intended to be
sufficient to support reasonably "intelligent" error management, for example, 
for remote procedure calls.  We note that some changes to the existing
error reporting facilities of various systems may be needed to facilitate
automatic handling of errors, particularly through a remote call.


<H3>Lack of Types</H3>

As demonstrated at MEGA'96, prototype2.1 used an essentially untyped
representation: the "parse tree" representation.  It relied on the built-in
algebraic manipulation capabilities of the host systems (REDUCE, Maple, and
CoCoA) to convert the parse tree into the application specific
representation.  Output using the parse tree format was very simple since the
internal structures of these systems were tree-like.

<P>
Types were not implemented in the prototype for various reasons, but
primarily due to lack of time (both to design how to incorporate type
information and to implement the design).  Moreover, for the small examples
demonstrated (remote polynomial factorization, and remote polynomial
decomposition) the advantages to including type information would not be
evident: though, strictly, we must specify over which field to perform the
factorization, and this information would naturally be supplied by the type
of the polynomial.

<P>
Although REDUCE and Maple are largely untyped systems, in many cases it
would not be hard for them to synthesize the necessary type information
when they make or respond to a remote procedure call via OpenMath.  In
contrast, in typed systems, it may be important to have the type of the
data given explicitly.  For instance, the GCD of two polynomials with
coefficients which happen to be integers depends on whether the polynomials
are actually over the integers or the rationals.


<H3>Incompleteness</H3>

Not surprisingly, the prototype design and implementations are not yet
"complete".  We hope that during discussions at this workshop a priority
can be placed on the inclusion of the various absent features such as
machine precision floating point numbers, type information, and quantified
variables.
