<H2>Motivation</H2>

Bob Sutor in <A HREF="ObjectCompatibility.html">his talk</A> has already
explained that certain platforms come supplied with a built-in object
transfer protocol allowing complete, structured objects to be transmitted
directly.  For interprocess communications on these platforms there are
advantages to using the innate technology.  On the other hand, there are
still many platforms for which no such protocol yet exists; similarly for
communications between different platforms.  Thus, to be widely portable
and to support cross-platform links, OpenMath must define its own "object
transfer protocol"; we present here the main features which this protocol
should have (based on our experience with building prototypes)..


<H2>Analysis</H2>

The principal difference between "network compatibility" and "object
compatibility" is that the former assumes only a byte-stream-like transport
medium while the latter allows for more sophisticated media.  Thus an
object compatible implementation may bypass some of the lower layers in the
OpenMath model (see the <A HREF="../../reports/objectives.ps.gz">Objectives
Document</A>).  At one extreme, an object compatible implementation is
permitted merely to take a standard OpenMath encoding (i.e. as produced by
a network compatible implementation) and transport it as a string object.
At the other extreme, it might be possible to transmit an OpenMath object
directly.

<P>
In this document we concentrate on the lowest two or three layers: OpenMath
Expression, OpenMath data-structure, and OpenMath encoding.  During
prototyping the design decisions concerning these layers usually involved a
compromise between what seemed "best" and what could be achieved before a
specific deadline.

<P>
We recall also that the <A
HREF="../../reports/objectives.ps.gz">Objectives Document</A> stated that
it was not necessary for the different layers to be readily distinguishable
in an implementation, but that the important criterion was that the
OpenMath object received should be semantically equivalent to the one sent.
Indeed, in our implementations of prototype2.1 both the OpenMath object and
the OpenMath expression layers had only ephemeral existences.
The sections below describe some of the more abstract design decisions
which were taken during the development of prototypes 2.0 and 2.1; greater
detail will be given in the talk on <A HREF="PrototypeNews.html">OpenMath
Prototypes</A>.


<H3>OpenMath Data-Structure: Trees</H3>

The principal choice for the OpenMath data-structure was between a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and a tree.  For the last few prototypes we chose to
use a tree because it allowed a simpler implementation (in REDUCE, Maple,
and CoCoA), because the extra capabilities offered by DAGs would not be of
use at this stage, and because the ability of DAGs to represent shared
structure can easily be subsumed by an alternative mechanism: <A
HREF="PrototypeNews.html#conversations">conversations</A>.  Other factors
favouring trees include the fact that many programming systems/languages
support trees readily, while relatively few support DAGs as easily.

<P>
In summary, the choice is not especially clear cut, but the differences
between the two options are quite small in any case.  Something I regard as
an advantage of using trees is that shared substructure is explicit even
above the data-structure level, but this is only an opinion.


<H3>OpenMath Object to OpenMath Tree</H3>

The specification of an OpenMath tree was developed in parallel with the
algorithm for converting between objects and trees; the aim was to keep
both the tree structure and the algorithm "simple".  We note in our
implementations the transition from application specific representation to
OpenMath tree was effected as a single step, though this may not always be
possible/convenient for more complicated mathematical data.  The object and
expression levels are represented only as program state.

<P>
The <A HREF="../../prototypes/2.1.tar.gz">specifications</A> for
prototype2.1 describe OpenMath trees with 15 different types of node.
Some of the node types are used directly to represent data while others
have a more "managerial" role, for OpenMath is a complete protocol not
merely a data representation.  Most node types have fixed numbers of
children, just two allow varied numbers.

<P>
OpenMath contexts play a vital role in the conversions between objects and
trees.  For the prototypes only a very simple scheme of contexts was used:
a context was no more than an indexed list of symbols whose meanings were
described in a human-only comprehensible form.  As a more sophisticated
internal structure for contexts becomes stable, the extra information
thereby represented can be exploited during the conversion processes.

<P>
It is important to bear in mind that a context may be extended between the
time that an OpenMath object is converted to an OpenMath tree and the time
that the object is reconstructed from the tree: think of data stored in an
archive.  Thus the manner in which contexts are used for these conversions
should permit extensions to the contexts without invalidating or altering
the meaning of OpenMath data stored in an archive.  This is also the reason
why deletions from officially registered contexts are not allowed.  Note:
although it is an OpenMath encoding which is stored in an archive, the
conversion between a tree and its linear encoding is independent of all
contexts; thus it is fair to say that an archive contains OpenMath trees.


<H3>OpenMath Encoding</H3>

We <A HREF="../../reports/objectives.ps.gz">recall</A> that an
<b>encoding</b> is a reversible linearization of the OpenMath tree.
The primary decision here was to make it explicit that the
linearization should be based on a pre-order traversal of the OpenMath
tree.  There are no real technical difficulties encountered during
conversion between OpenMath trees and their encodings.  The biggest problems
were how to encode big integers (as opposed to integers of strictly limited
magnitude, typically representable in 32 bits), and machine precision
floating point (MPFP) numbers without being unreasonably inefficient in some
cases.

<P>
The difficulty with big integers is that different systems use different
internal representations, and the cost of conversion is super-linear in the
length of the integer: in general, the complexity of converting base of an
integer of length n is the smaller of n*n and M(n)*log(n) where M(n) is
the cost of multiplying together two integers of length n.  Barring Maple,
all computer algebra systems use a binary representation permitting a
linear time inter-conversion.  Imposing a binary representation would make
Maple to Maple communication via OpenMath unreasonably slow if many large
integers are to be exchanged; in this case a "decimal" representation is
the only acceptable solution.  Moreover, integer values sent to a
typesetting system, say, must also be in a "decimal" form since it is not
reasonable to require the typesetter to perform base conversion on
arbitrary precision integers.

<P>
A similar problem arises for MPFP numbers.  Here the problem is that
numerical computations frequently involve very large numbers of floating
point values, and if a large array is to be transmitted the cost of
changing the format a MPFP number is multiplied manifold.  A
more serious aspect of changing format is that precision may be lost, or
some values may be unrepresentable (e.g. magnitude is too great or too
small).  When both sender and receiver have the same internal format for
MPFP numbers, OpenMath should allow them to use that format for
data exchange.

<P>
The solution proposed is for every <A
HREF="PrototypeNews.html#conversations">conversation</A> to be preceded by a
negotiation phase where the format to be used for big integers, and for
MPFP numbers is determined at run-time.  This does pose problems when
OpenMath is to be used for archival or other "non-interactive" purposes
such as drag-and-drop, and communication via email.  In these cases the
sender knows little about the receiver, but ultimate efficiency is also
less important: a "decimal" representation for big integers must be used in
case the receiver is a typesetter; it is much less clear what format to use
for MPFP numbers.

<P>
Once the idea of negotiation is introduced, it can be extended to cover
other aspects.  One possible choice is the alphabet (and encoding) for
strings: ASCII (or ISO-Latin-1) is an obvious choice for English speakers,
while the full range of UniCode may be needed in some circumstances.
Another candidate for negotiation is the overall encoding of the OpenMath
tree: e.g. Lisp-like, based on ASAP, or based on MP.  In the prototypes to
date, renegotiation of encoding formats was not permitted during a
conversation because it seemed unnecessary, and could be risky.

<P>
If run-time negotiation is to be adopted as the correct approach then it
will be necessary to list all the various formats which may be chosen from
during negotiation; this may be tricky for floating point numbers.  Also a
default format must be chosen for MPFP numbers to use in "non-interactive"
situations; this default should be capable of representing without loss of
precision any number from any of the current common formats for MPFP
numbers (and any likely future format).


<H3>Error Reporting</H3>

If OpenMath is used as the protocol for a remote procedure call then a
means of returning an error response will sometimes be needed.  Probably
the simplest way to do this is to have two types of message: a normal
response and an error response, exactly one of which will be returned for
each remote call.  A disadvantage of this method is that the complete
response to a remote call must be computed and stored in the server before
any part of it can be sent.

<P>
It was decided that the "naive" solution described above was too
restrictive, and instead a more flexible, but hardly more complicated,
scheme was devised: the linear encoding of an OpenMath tree may be
"interrupted" at almost any point by an error message.  This permits the
server to interleave computation with sending back of the result: there is
no problem if an error occurs after part of the result has already been
sent back.  It also provides a convenient mechanism for allowing the user
(in an interactive environment) to terminate prematurely the transmission
of an excessively long result.

<P>
The ability of an error report to "interrupt" the encoding of a tree
probably cannot be exploited by "object compatible" data transfer.  On the
other hand, there is no obligation on the server to interleave computation
and transmission of a result; the OpenMath error reporting mechanism merely
permits it.
