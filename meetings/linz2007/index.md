title: 8th OpenMath Meeting (joint with JEM)
---

RISC, Schloss Hagenberg, University of Linz
June 25-26th, 2007






The 8th OpenMath Workshop is a meeting place for developers and
    users of the OpenMath standard. The recent developments and
    applications of OpenMath are presented at this yearly event.

    OpenMath is a standard for communicating semantically-rich
    representations of mathematical objects between all kinds of
    computer programs. The communication can take place between
    software packages and on the World Wide Web. The associated tools
    will permit the display, manipulation and access of mathematical
    information stored electronically.

##Remotely Watching the Workshop


Recordings of the Workshop are being processed and have a quite variable
degree of quality unfortunately (with some holes and some sound missing).
Please find:


* [Recording of day 1](movies/day-1.html) 
  (and its [reference movie](openmath-ws07-day-1.mov))
  (Miner, Kohlhase, Discussion &amp; Panel, Libbrecht,
  Xambo, Verrijzer, Rabe, Davenport)

* [Recording of day 2](movies/day-1.html#Paul) 
    (and its [reference movie](openmath-ws07-day-2.mov))
    (Seppälä, Carlisle, Miller, Ion, Miesenberger, Watt, Eixarch (low-Q), 
    Pauna (low-Q), Cerval-Peña (low-Q, no-sound))
  



All recordings are downloaded as an html page which can use javascript to navigate
 between the presentations or a very small reference movie which downloads
 the video content using the rtsp protocol. Only the parts viewed are actually
 downloaded and rewinding and forwarding always works though bandwidth
 may make it require a few seconds.




The workshop waspresented in rtsp in live from the URLs.



The ability to play the stream may strongly depend on network configuration and proxies.
It is advised to use a firewall free NAT-free network but usage of UPnP and other protocols
may help. If you can play the test stream at 
 [http://media.activemath.org/sample_h264_300kbit.mp4](http://media.activemath.org/sample_h264_300kbit.mp4) 
 you will be able to watch the stream. Note that the jaggering-at-start is normal.


<!-- authors will be requested to run the desktop-presenter if possible as long as network
  on their machine http://www.varasoftware.com/products/wirecast/download.html
  or tightVNC -->




##Scope


The main themes of this year's meeting will be the Alignment with     
    MathML3 and the use of OpenMath in Education. The program will     
    consist of tutorials and contributed talks, and will be organized     
    into two one-day tracks.



The W3C has chartered the Math Working Group with revising the MathML2     
standard until Spring 2008. In this endeavor, the Math working group
    is revising the content-MathML sublanguage to be isomorphic with     
    OpenMath. This will greatly enhance interoperability of content    
    communication for math software systems. We will start off the track by
    an OpenMath/MathML tutorial, and a presentation of the current content     
    MathML3 working draft.         
    The main topic will be discussions on technical issues of the alignment,     
    possible changes to OpenMath, and perspectives for content Mathematics.
    


    

The JEM, Joining Educational Mathematics, thematic network is promoting
  contributions that highlight new developments and  use of semantic markup
  in digital content designed for eLearning. The possibility to
  manipulate and communicate mathematical objects without loss of
  information allows for rich, interactive materials that are ideal in
  education. New technologies, software
  libraries and tools, case studies, comparative  surveys, and success stories
  related to semantic markup such e.g. OpenMath, Content MathML, MathBook-MathDox,
  OMDoc, MathQTI, PhysML,  are also welcome.


##Related Events
