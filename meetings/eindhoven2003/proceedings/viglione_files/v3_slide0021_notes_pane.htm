  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>MoMAM@th has been
  experimented at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Salerno. It
  has been used as a complementary tool for the first year mathematics
  students. The students attending traditional lectures have used the software
  for their own extra exercise sessions.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>Some students have sent
  e-mails to teachers asking for help on how to write textually mathematic
  expressions with Mathematica syntax, and other students have sent comments
  about the fact that in MoMAM@th it’s not possible to copy and paste the
  graphical part of the formula.</font><br>

  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>Hence student feedback has
  underlined two more important limits that the MoMAM@th exercises have: they
  don't allow the learner to write the formulas in symbolic notation and
  obviously it is not allowed to copy and paste among graphical and textual
  parts of a formula.</font><br>
