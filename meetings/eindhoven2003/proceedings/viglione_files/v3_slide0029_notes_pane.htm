  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>The problem with the current
  technologies for putting mathematics on the web is that they are too
  complicated and ad hoc. It often takes expert knowledge and programming skill
  to get different math software packages to work together, but no single
  approach provides a complete answer. The remedy is obviously standard. MathML
  support is already widespread and it plays a pivotal role for dynamic math in
  Web pages. MathML equations can be manipulated using JavaScript, Applets and
  plug-ins can send MathML-encoded equations to server-side software such as
  computer algebra systems or scientific visualization software. However both
  MathML and plug-ins do not support <i>template </i>and <i>placeholder </i>as
  described by us. MathML deals only with complete formulas and not with
  formulas that may contain parts to fill, and more precisely parts that need
  to be filled in a specific way.</font><br>
