  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>Our solution seems far from
  being the best one. AT the moment in order to create a formula in the way
  described before we need to do a lot of work at the level of “Template.m”
  package. This means that who creates the exercise has to also take into
  account how to generate the structure that the user will use to provide the
  answer, and often the result is not very appealing from an aesthetic point of
  view. In the browser if the formula is too long and overcomes the maximum
  horizontal window size, it doesn’t distribute on more lines but causes the
  horizontal scrolling of the browser window. In this way the learner cannot
  see the formula fully but he will have to use the horizontal scroll bar to
  see all the mathematic expression.</font><br>

 <tr>
  <td colspan=1></td>
  <td align=left colspan=1><font face=Arial size=3>Moreover, many times the
  format of the answer is not easy to respect; for example, if the exercise
  needs to receive the base of a vector space for the answer, the user should
  give in input something similar to {{1,2,3},{5,6,4},{2,3,4}}, which is not
  very intuitive.</font><br>
