  would be that standard MathML is directly able to deal with formulas
  containing a <i>template </i>described by special operators<i>.</i> In the
  last years the didactic contents used for the e-learning have become more and
  more interactive and more widely used. In the case of the mathematics,
  MoMAM@th application constitutes a valid example of such interactive
  contents.</font><br>

  surely will be used in e-learning applications about scientific domains, will
  have to be suitable to support the kind of interactivity and structures
  described before. The possibility to use a standard will assure the
  development of exercises for the web that are independent from client
  plug-ins and CASs.</font><br>
