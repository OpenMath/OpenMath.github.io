<H2>HLS - Technical Plan</H2></CENTER>
<P>This plan does not represent the current status of the project, rather it is 
an overview of the features that HLS (Helsinki Learning System) should 
have.&nbsp;

<H2>Overview of components</H2>
<P>HLS has the following components, each described later.&nbsp; 
<P align=center><IMG height=411 src="HLS_files/fig1.jpg" 
width=539 border=0> 
<H3><A name=datastructures></A>1. Databases and data structures</H3>
<P>The data structures of the HLS system are xml documents stored in an xml 
database. The structure of these data bases is specified by xml document type 
definitions (dtds). There are following data bases in HLS: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>ccd, course content dictionary.</B> Defines the topical hierarchy of 
  the content. Defines also additional information concerning topics. 
  <LI><B>problems. </B>Problems which can be of type multiple choice, yes or no, 
  string and essay. 
  <LI><B>exercises. </B>Exercises consist of several problems and information 
  about in which order the system offers them to the user. Also hints and other 
  feedback concerning problems are stored in exercises. 
  <LI><B>userdb.</B> User data base stores user accounts to the system. </LI></UL>
<H4>1.1 CCD</H4>
<P>Course content dictionary contains the topic hierarchy of courses. Each 
course has an entry in the ccd. The topics covered in the course are listed 
under that course. The topic hierarchy is recursive, i.e. each topic has its 
subtopics as topic subelements. Courses and topics contain also additional 
description data. This data is <I>not yet specified</I>. The use of ccd in 
problem and exercise data bases is pictured below. 
<P align=center><IMG height=438 src="HLS_files/fig2.jpg" 
width=581 border=0> 
<H4>1.2 Meta data</H4>Each problem and exercise contains <I>meta data</I>, which 
describe its content: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>TimeStamp. </B>When the document was last modified. 
  <LI><B>Author. </B>The author of the document and the url to the author. 
  <LI><B>Copyright owner.</B> Copyright owner of the document. 
  <LI><B>Level. </B>Level of difficulty of the problem or exercise. A percentage 
  of the successful attempts of solving it. 
  <LI><B>Relevant text. </B>A standard text book which covers the topic of the 
  document. 
  <LI><B>Course. </B>A reference to the course in the ccd to which the problem 
  or exercise belongs. 
  <LI><B>Topic.</B> A reference to the topic in the ccd to which the problem or 
  exercise belong. </LI></UL>
<H4>1.3 Problems</H4>
<P>All types of problems have problem text. Problem can contain several language 
versions. Different types of problems contain specific data: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Multiple choice:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>All the <B>choices</B> and the information whether they are correct or 
    false. </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Yes or no:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>The <B>correct answer</B> as yes or no. </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>String:</B> 
  <UL>
    <LI>The <B>correct answer</B> as a string. 
    <LI><B>Encoding of the answer</B>, e.g. Maple or Mathematica. 
    <LI><B>Evaluation guide</B>, which tells how the user's answer and the 
    correct answer should be compared. </LI></UL>
  <LI><B>Essay:&nbsp; </B><I>Not yet specified.</I> </LI></UL>
<H4>1.4 Exercises</H4>
<P>Exercises consist of sequences of problems. Each member of the sequence is a 
reference to a problem in the problem data base with additional information. 
There are three different types of user actions, correct answer, wrong answer, 
and I don't know answer. For each of these types of actions there is stored the 
following information: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Feedback, </B>which the system should displays to the user. 
  <LI><B>Reference to a problem</B> which the system displays next to the user. 
  Can also be left empty, when it means that the exercise ends. 
  <LI>Information whether to display the correct solution. </LI></UL>
<H4>1.5 Users</H4>
<P>According to the privileges there are different types of users, the higher 
types have all the privileges of the lower types: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>administrator.</B> Can freely modify all the content of the databases. 
  Can create new user accounts. 
  <LI><B>lecturer.</B> Can create ccd's, modify their own ccd's, modify all 
  problems and exercises of their own courses. Can create new user accounts on 
  levels lecturer and editor. 
  <LI><B>editor.</B> The default level. Can create and modify their own problems 
  and exercises. Can create and modify their own user accounts. 
  <LI>Users without privileges can view the content of the problem and exercise 
  data bases. </LI></UL>
<H3><A name=applications></A>2. Applications</H3>
<P><BR>There are two applications of the data bases. First is a tool to modify 
the content, called editor. Users log in to the editor and can modify the 
databases according to their privileges. Content can be added, changed, 
previewed, and deleted. 
<P>The second application is for the students of the material. The application 
presents exercises to the user and allows solving them. It displays the feedback 
coded in the exercises and can also display an overview of the students 
strengths and weaknesses according to the course's topics. 
<H2><A name=techoverview></A>Technical overview</H2>
<P>The applications are web based, meaning that they are used with a web 
browser. Also they are client - server applications, since the client uses the 
server's data bases. Overview of the system is pictured below: 
<P align=center><IMG height=297 src="HLS_files/fig3.jpg" 
width=623 border=0> 
<H3>1. Client side</H3>
<P>Clients use the applications with a web browser. The web browser needs the 
IBM TechExplorer plug-in for displaying material written with TeX. 
<H3>2. Server side</H3>
<P>In the server side servlets are used as to handle the user interface and 
user's actions. Standard xml libraries are used to work with xml data. All 
applications are written in the Java programming language. 
<H3>3. Interfaces</H3>
<P>As the data structures and the applications should be flexible, there is an 
interface between them. This allows the changing of the implementation of the 
data base without changing the applications as long as the interface does not 
change. Also the applications can change without affecting the data base 
definitions. These interfaces are coded using the Java language. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H2><A name=installing></A>Installing the HLS system</H2>
<P>HLS system is a web application that is installed into a directory structure 
in a java enabled web server. The preferred server is Apache Tomcat 4. HLS 
system should be rooted at a directory called <TT>hls</TT>. The direcoty 
structure is following:
