title: OpenMath Workshops
---

From time to time various meetings are organised by the [OpenMath Society](../society) and
by the various associated [OpenMath Projects](../projects).  This page collects slides and
notes from those meetings. The numbering of the workshops somewhat haphazard (and is off
by 4 for the newest counting), as the naming of the workshops was often governed by
project requirements.

* The sixth OpenMath workshop was held immediately after the ISSAC conference
in Zurich on Saturday 27th and Sunday 28th July 1996.

* The fifth OpenMath Workshop was held on 12-13 January 1996 at the
University of Bath.  This workshop had relatively few presentations, and
instead most time was spent in discussion groups particularly addressing
some problems highlighted by the then most recent prototype.  [Notes](oldws/proceedings-5.html)
* The fourth OpenMath Workshop took place on 1-2 September 1995 in Copenhagen.  [workshop schedule and scanned copies of slides](oldws/proceedings-4.html)
* The third OpenMath Workshop took place on 9-10 February 1995 at RIACA (Research Institute for Applications of Computer Algebra) in Amsterdam.

* The Second OpenMath Workshop took place on 18-19 July 1994 (just before
ISSAC'94) at St. Catherine's College, Oxford University. [proceedings](oldws/proceedings-2.html)
* The First OpenMath Workshop took place at the Department of Mathematical Computation,
ETH Zurich in December 1993.  The [preliminary report](oldws/proceedings-1.html) on the
workshop stimulated discussion on the OpenMath mailing list.
