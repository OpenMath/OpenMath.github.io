* The fifth OpenMath Workshop was held on 12-13 January 1996 at the
University of Bath.  This workshop had relatively few presentations, and
instead most time was spent in discussion groups particularly addressing
some problems highlighted by the then most recent prototype.  [Notes](oldws/proceedings-5.html)
* The fourth OpenMath Workshop took place on 1-2 September 1995 in Copenhagen.  [workshop schedule and scanned copies of slides](oldws/proceedings-4.html)

* The Second OpenMath Workshop took place on 18-19 July 1994 (just before
ISSAC'94) at St. Catherine's College, Oxford University. [proceedings](oldws/proceedings-2.html)
