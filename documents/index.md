## The OpenMath Standards

* The [OpenMath Standard](../standard/index.html#openmath-standard) describes the
structure of OpenMath objects, encodings and content dictionaries.
* The
  [Symbolic Computation Software Composability Protocol (SCSCP)](../standard/index.html#symbolic-computation-software-composability-protocol-scscp)
  specifies how OpenMath-encoded objects can be communicated between software systems for
  remote procedure calls. 
* There are also a number of associated documents describing different kinds of type systems
which can be used to augment the information in content dictionaries.

## Useful Documents

* [On Writing OpenMath Content Dictionaries](writingCDs.pdf)
(PDF) A set of guidelines for prospective CD authors.
* [Conversion between MathML and OpenMath](om-mml.pdf) (PDF)
A detailed description of the correspondance between symbols in content MathML
and the MathML Cd Group.
* [A discussion document on Units in OpenMath. (PDF)](Units.pdf) 
* [OpenMath Society Royalty-Free (RF) Licensing Requirements](openmath-ipr)
