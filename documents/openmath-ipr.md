OpenMath Society on 2013-12-01 however it also applies to the existing OpenMath Standard
and Content Dictionaries.
* The OpenMath 1 standard (2000) and most of the core Content Dictionaries were developed
under an EU ESPRIT project <a

in which all materials and any underlying patent licenses that may be required were made
available by project members on a Royalty Free basis as part of the contract terms of that
project.
* The OpenMath 2 standard and the updated Core Content Dictionaries were developed under
the EU funded OpenMath Thematic network.
All contributions under this project were made available under Royalty Free basis, and
Copyright assigned to the OpenMath Society.
