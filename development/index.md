Various parts of OpenMath are currently under development by members of the
[OpenMath Society](./society/). Most of the development is organized publicakly via our
[GitHub Group](https://github.com/OpenMath). Please feel free to contribute by opening
issues, contributing fixes or extensions via merge requests, or contributing
OpenMath-related software (we will be happy to give you a repository for that).
