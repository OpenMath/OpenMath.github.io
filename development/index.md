title: Development of OpenMath
---

Various parts of OpenMath are currently under development by members of the
[OpenMath Society](society/). Most of the development is organized publicly via our
[GitHub Group](https://github.com/OpenMath). Please feel free to contribute by opening
issues, contributing fixes or extensions via merge requests, or contributing
OpenMath-related software (we will be happy to give you a repository for that). 

* [OpenMath Standard](https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSTD)
* [OpenMath Content Dictionaries](https://github.com/OpenMath/OM3) 
* [OpenMath Web Site](https://github.com/OpenMath/openmath.github.io)
* [Extensions of OpenMath](https://github.com/OpenMath/OM3)

#### Development Roadmap

The OpenMath Workshop 2017 determined that the focus of development should be on extending
the supply of content dictionaries and language integrations to fix OpenMath's birth
defect of not having a credible supply. Consequently extending the OpenMath Standard (OM
Objects and OM Content Dictionaries are deprioritized for the coming year, but we continue
to collect [extensions proposals](https://github.com/OpenMath/OM3).
 
The current set of projects is

* referencing and indexing extenal CD sources
* developing new langauge integrating
* redoing the OpenMath Software page
