title: OpenMath Software And Tools
---

A document giving guidelines for OpenMath tool developers is
available [from the OpenMath thematic network.](../projects/thematic/tools-3.pdf).

If you have developed any OpenMath software that should be listed here, please send the link and a short description to [om@openmath.org](../lists/).

## OpenMath Validation
[An XSLT stylesheet for validating OpenMath Fragments contained within XML documents](validate.html)

## OpenMath Phrasebooks

* A phrasebook for [AXIOM 2.3](http://www.nag.co.uk) was shipped with the system.
* A phrasebook for GAP 4 is available from the [GAP 4 website](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/).
* A phrasebook for Mathematica has been developed by [INRIA](mailto:stephane.dalmas@sophia.inria.fr).

* Various phrasebooks for GAP, Magma and Mathematica are available from [RIACA](http://www.riaca.win.tue.nl/products/).

##OpenMath Demos and Applications

* [Algebra Interactive](http://www.win.tue.nl/~ida) An interactive algebra course.
* FOC, a set of certified computer algebra libraries, supports OpenMath.
* [An OpenMath Shell](http://www.riaca.win.tue.nl/products/) for sending OpenMath to a computational engine. 
* [A computation service using GAP](http://www.riaca.win.tue.nl/products/)
* [A computation service using Mathematica](http://www.riaca.win.tue.nl/products/)
* [LaTeX to OpenMath translator demo ](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~richardt/openmath)

## OpenMath Stylesheets

    <!-- BROKEN on 2010-10-19
*  Stylesheet for <link
uri="http://www.orcca.on.ca/~clare/om_cmml/src/omtocmml.xsl">OpenMath to
Content MathML</link> Conversion.</li>
-->

<!-- BROKEN on 2010-10-19
*  Stylesheet for <link
uri="http://www.orcca.on.ca/~clare/om_cmml/src/cmmltoom.xsl">
Content MathML to OpenMath</link> Conversion.</li>
-->

<!-- BROKEN on 2010-10-19
*  [XSLT stylesheet](http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~bpalmer/cmml2om/)
for converting Content MathML to OpenMath.  
-->

* The current build system of the OpenMath Website is [described in a how-to](http://www.openmath.org/infrastructure/website-build.html).
  It processes normal pages with [om-page.xsl](http://svn.openmath.org/www/stylesheets/html/om-page.xsl)
  and CD pages with [cd.xsl](http://svn.openmath.org/www/cdfiles2/xsl/cd.xsl)
  which uses [om2pmml.xsl](http://svn.openmath.org/www/cdfiles2/xsl/om2pmml.xsl) 
  for OpenMath to presentation MathML, [om2popcorn.xsl](http://svn.openmath.org/www/cdfiles2/xsl/om2popcorn.xsl) to PopCorn,
  and [om2cmml.xsl](http://svn.openmath.org/www/cdfiles2/xsl/om2cmml.xsl) to Content-MathML.
* David Carlisle has been the main author of these stylesheets and has taken this further
 in his [html5mathml project](https://code.google.com/p/html5mathml/) 
 with news and documentation in [blog](http://dpcarlisle.blogspot.de/).


*  <link uri="http://www.mathweb.org/omdoc/xsl.html">The OMDoc collection of XSLT stylesheets</link> for converting between OpenMath and OMDoc, OMDoc and MathML
  etc.

*  [DSSSL stylesheet for MathML](mml-files/index.html) Render MathML to TeX or RTF (For
   Microsoft Word)  

## OpenMath Development Tools

    <!-- BROKEN on 2010-10-19
* <link uri="http://www.riaca.win.tue.nl/products/openmath/lib/">The RIACA
OpenMath library</link>, a Java library for creating and using OpenMath
objects.
-->
* [INRIA C Library](OMCv1.4a.tgz), an API for reading, writing and creating OpenMath objects. 
* [INRIA C++ Library](OMCPPv1.0a.tgz), an API for reading, writing and creating OpenMath
  objects (requires <link uri="OMCv1.4a.tgz">INRIA C Library</link>). 
* [INRIA Java Library](OMJv1.4.tgz), an API for reading, writing and creating OpenMath objects.
*  An <link uri="http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~wn/AldorXML/index.html">OpenMath Library and XML parser</link> in the
  [Aldor](http://www.aldor.org) language are available from the University of Bath (formerly from Victoria University of Wellington).

## OpenMath Editors


* [CDEditor](http://www.unirioja.es/cu/joheras/openmath-editor.html), an OpenMath Content Dictionary editor. Available for [Linux](https://esus.unirioja.es/psycotrip/archivos_documentos/linux-dist.rar) and [Windows](https://esus.unirioja.es/psycotrip/archivos_documentos/windows-dist.rar)
